		My name is David Pearl, I am a second year, full-time, MHCDE student. Besides school, I also work remotely at a digital health consulting firm, CommunicateHealth. Yes, I'm in front of computers all day, but I also want to use them to make things in the real-world. I love ceramics as a hobby, and thought there could be an interesting overlap to explore. I always see cool things being made with 3D printers or laser cutters, but have no idea how to achieve those things, so I'd just hope to gain basic understanding so I can make things I want and join the vibrant community of makers.
