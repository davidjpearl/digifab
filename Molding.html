<h1>Assignment 7: Molding + Casting</h1>
<p>/Cover Image</p>
<h2>Goal: 3D print your molds-for-molds</h2>
<p>For this assignment, I began by finding a sculpture I liked. I picked Female Head by Amadeo Modigliani, a sculpture replica my grandma used to have in her home, that I kept for several years (until it broke during one of our moves.)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.myminifactory.com/assets/object-assets/5c0af63322682/images/720X720-img-20181107-133905033.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-amadeo-modigliani-female-head-1912-80774">3d model online</a>, and thought this would be a perfect project. I am in need of new mezuzahs, a tradition Jewish doorpost, so thought I could incorporate this sculpture with a space for a scroll.</p>
<p><img src="https://shop.thejewishmuseum.org/media/catalog/product/cache/e1151140f89558b45cdc4b0b96814ff6/rdi/rdi/limestone-mezuzah-ston-101028_1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="400" /></p>
<p>I imported the mold into Rhino, and began by reducing the mesh This was to bring it from ~157,000 down to ~20,000 polys. I also used "QuadRemesh" .</p>
<p>I dropped 2 holes for screw holes, and a tube for the scroll to fit into, removing space with "MeshBooleanDifference".</p>
<p>I used "contour" to split the piece in half. From the midpoint, I made 2 rectangles above and below, and included in 4 spheres. I also included an tube to pour in the plaster.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/davidjpearl/digifab-533/blob/main/MoldImages/Contour.png?raw=true" alt="" width="500" height="338" /></p>
<p>I copied the entirety twice, one as a backup and one to adjust. I removed the top section from one, the bottome section from the other and used "BooleanUnion" for additions and "BooleanDifference" for removals.</p>
<p>I added in a background, and extruded the edges. These edges will be to hold the plaster.</p>

<p>Initially, I used "RibbonOffset", but it was unable to use it properly, so added in a rectange on the back instead.</p>
<h3>Final Mold and 3D.</h3>

<p>I did a test print and liked how it was, so nowonce i finalizes size, I'll be ready for next week.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Casting</h2>
<p>After somehow getting my OOMOO through airport security, I arrived in Denver Colorado and began my mold making.</p>
<p>I prepared by putting on gloves, a mask, and finding a scale. I also used 2 sets of chopsticks to mix the parts and mix them together.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/davidjpearl/digifab-533/blob/main/CastingPhotos/Prep.JPG?raw=true" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>I used a 1:1 ratio of water to OOMOO. One issue I ran into was using too little, so I was only able to make the first mold. I was nervous about using small leftovers for the second one, and mixing 2 oomoo mixtures with different timings, so I decided to make a mold of a little magnet I bought in Hawaii a few years ago. </p>

<br />
<p>Then using some plaster of paris I bought, I mixed it up with a 2:1 ratio of water to dry plaster and wet the silicone mold before adding in the plaster per the container's instructions.<img src="https://github.com/davidjpearl/digifab-533/blob/main/CastingPhotos/MixPlaster.JPG?raw=true" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>I learned that a better consistancy for the plaster was 2:1 but using a scale. 2:1 with the same container was making my plaster too thick.</p>

<p>Bonus mold since there was extra OOMOO:</p>
